# Change-File-Names-with-Automator
When downloading files on certain macs, the computer will automatically add another file extension on top of what you already downloaded. For example when downloading a ".gff" file, the mac will add ".txt" at the end, making it ".gff.txt". When handling multiple files it becomes tedious to change, automator does it for you.
